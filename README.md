# Project U

The purpose of this repository is to store documents which record my knowledge of Project U. At the moment few are even aware of its existence and therefore unaware of the serious threat that it poses to the public. 

## What is Project U?

Project U is a multifaceted science experiment which has been in existence for many decades. It has many aims and objectives. A major component involves the use of advanced technologies designed to artificially enhance human test subjects to give them advantages over ordinary people.

## Who am I?

My life spans almost four decades and for the majority of that time I have been a test subject of Project U. A fact of which I was unaware until around three years ago. In these last three years I have learned a great deal about the project, its aims, the people involved and the potential dangers of the technology being developed. I assess the threat to be so great that I must now act, no matter the cost.

## Who is running Project U?

It is run by a network of entities in the private sector who coordinate and collaborate for mutual benefit. Their primary business is the accumulation of wealth and power which they achieve by various means. They are able to extract economic value from Project U in several ways which help to further consolidate that wealth and power. [More info](https://www.projectu.link/mediawiki/index.php/The_Network)

## What technologies are used in Project U?

Various technologies are used to enhance test subjects. A core piece of technology is a neural interface which allows the reading of somebody's mind to a very high degree of accuracy. Whilst there may be some [legitimate](https://neuralink.com/) medical uses for such a device, the most troubling aspect of its use in Project U is that test subjects have no idea it is there, they have not chosen to have it implanted, and they have no way of turning it off or removing it.

## Why you should care

You should care because some technologies utilised in Project U will eventually be deployed to the wider population. Specifically the neural interface that allows the reading of somebody's thoughts. It is only a matter of time and progress before they gain the ability to make that dystopian nightmare our reality. They were able to implant these technologies into my body without my knowledge or consent, and they will eventually figure out how to do that at a much larger scale. You may believe that nobody would be foolish enough to want that outcome, but this group possesses an extreme capacity for [self-delusion](https://www.projectu.link/mediawiki/index.php/The_Network#Self_delusions). They would find a way to justify this action.

## Can I prove it?

I have done some work to prove the existence of the neural interface. You can read about my efforts [here](https://www.projectu.link/mediawiki/index.php/How_I_Know_I_Have_A_Neural_Interface#Evidence_so_far). The Wiki where I have documented the majority of my knowledge serves to build up a picture of what I know and how I know it. It is not proof in itself but hopefully does lend some credibility to the information I have provided, especially to the people who know me. Those who know I always try and understand the world in strictly rational terms. I am no conspiracy theorist.

## So what now?

My first priority is to provide conclusive, peer reviewed evidence of at least one my implants to enable me to take my story to the media. It should not prove too difficult, I have outlined various ways here. If you think you can help, please contact me at [mk.ultra.zero@pm.me](mailto:mk.ultra.zero@pm.me)

Once the alarm is sounded I'd expect several things to happen. Facilities must be made available so that anyone can check to see if they have been implanted with a device without their consent. Hopefully all the other test subjects can be found. In the longer term we must put protections in place to minimise the danger that humanity goes any further down this very dark path. Laws must be implemented and international treaties signed to prevent the further proliferation of such technologies.
