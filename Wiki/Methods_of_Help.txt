=== Neural interface device ===
There is a sphere shaped device, embedded in my brain and attached to my skull, located towards the top rear of my head. There is also a transmitter capable of sending and receiving data and also a battery for storing power. I am not sure if the battery and transmitter are in the same location or if they are located somewhere else in my body. I've had my attention drawn to my sternum as an area of interest, indicating a possible location for those components. That area could have been highlighted to me for other reasons. 

==== What for ====
It reads my brain waves and transmits them to a remote location using whatever wireless network is available in the area. WIFI, cellular, possibly blue tooth. It is also capable of receiving commands and transmitting signals into my nervous system. The most important function of the device I suppose is the transmitting of my brain waves to a remote location. The device itself would be too small to contain the processing power required to read my mind itself. Instead the brain waves must be transmitted in a raw form to a location with powerful computing capability which would be able to analyse the raw data and interpret them into sounds and images. It can also cause my limbs to move, alter my heart rate, it can possibly effect my mood, I strongly believe it can alter the contents of my dreams. It functions as a kill switch allowing the operator to remotely kill me via heart attack or somehow causing a stroke.

==== How do I know ====
As this is the one people would be most interested/concerned with. I've dedicated a separate page for this [[How_I_Know_I_Have_A_Neural_Interface|topic]]

==== Negative effects ====
There are many negative consequences to having a neural interface that can read your mind. 

* I have lost my most fundamental privacy, the privacy of my mind. It can be truly horrible, to live in a reality knowing that your every thought can be read. I have learned to live with it but it is not something I would wish upon anyone. There was a time when I would actually be fearful of my thoughts, fearful of what my subconscious would produce. We have far less control over what we think than what we say. The human mind is not meant to exist in a state where it understands it is being read at all times. It is not natural. 

* It makes you vulnerable to being murdered remotely. Living in a state and knowing that could happen at any time is not pleasant. To put it mildly it puts a strain on ones mental health.

* It makes you vulnerable to unique forms of torture such as [[Timeline#19th_July_2021|sleep deprivation]]. 

* It turns everyone with a neural interface into a walking CCTV camera with a microphone. They can see what I see, hear what I hear.  

* It makes you far more vulnerable to targetted manipulations.

* It makes it impossible to create a unique business without the idea being stolen first. No matter how quickly you could work, they have far more resources. They can spin up a business and implement an idea in a fraction of the time you could. 

There is no one in their right mind who would choose to have an implant like this. I had no medical need for having this placed in my head. I would '''never''' have chosen it.

=== Blood transfusions ===
I have been given blood transfusions.

==== What for ====
It is [https://www.genengnews.com/topics/translational-medicine/muscle-rejuvenating-factor-uncovered-in-circulating-extracellular-vesicles known to science] that blood transfusions from a young donor will have a rejuvenating effect on an older recipient. I suppose the reason for doing it is that, a significant sum of money is invested in each individual and slowing down somebody's ageing process is a way of ensuring that investment retains its value for as long as possible. 

==== How do I know ====
I do not know how many I have received or when I was given the first one. My first indication was was being indirectly referred to as a vampire in conversation. I had read about the rejuvenating effects of blood transfusions long before suspecting I had received any. When it was implied that I immediately found that plausable. In my late 20's and 30's I've appeared significantly younger than I actually am with people often guessing a difference of at least 10 years below my actual age. I have on occasion experienced faint pain on my inner left arm, just below the elbow, which could be a possible location for the transfusion tube.

==== Negative effects ====
None that I am aware of.


=== Brain altering treatment ===
My brain has been altered resulting in several different effects. I do not know the nature of the treatment, whether it was one treatment or multiple treatments.

==== What for ====

Raising intelligence, enhancing ones reflexes. They may have given me this treatment as it would've helped me become a scientist or engineer. From a very young age I had demonstrated a clear interest in those fields, regularly maxing out my monthly allowance at the library, usually on books which were science and technology based. I believe there was an element which reduced my sense of empathy, perhaps with the aim of making me more ruthless. A trait which can be beneficial in several fields.

==== How do I know ====
The first time I learned of this was when a friend of mine (who I shall not name), indirectly implied that I had been artificially enhanced by referencing the movie [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_(2014_film) Lucy 2014] in which the character is able to unlock enhanced mental abilities after receiving a drug. Looking back at my early childhood, certain memories started to make more sense. I recall there was a time in primary school, between roughly the ages of 7-10 when I became rather unsociable. Instead of playing with my friends I would wander the playground, lost in my own thoughts as my mind raced with ideas for crazy inventions. I had seen the movie 'Back to the Future' and had it my mind that I could create a time machine. This went on for some time, I don't remember for how long exactly. That behaviour certainly didn't continue into High School however since then I suppose I've found it easier to think and conceptualise ideas in mind. The cost of that ability was in my reduced desire for social interaction, becoming more content to be on my own with my own thoughts.

I have extremely good reflexes and there have been several occasions where I have been able to demonstrate an almost Jedi like ability. Two events come to mind. The first was in primary school where I was able to hit a friend with a tennis ball filled with water from a considerable distance. He was running away from me and I was able to judge his movement perfectly so the ball hit him square on the head. The other was when I threw a 50p coin into the small cup of a homeless fellow. I felt completely at ease, pulling the coin from my pocket and flicking it into the cup in one smooth motion.

==== Negative effects ====
I suppose the overall effect was that it gave me the symptoms of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome Asperger Syndrome].

Had I been given a choice, I certainly would not have opted to have this treatment/s. It has resulted in a diminished quality of life as I have found it difficult to stay present in the current moment, my mind tends to always turn inwards. The effects on my personal life have been quite detrimental as I've always found it difficult to make and maintain social connections. People consider me insensitive and I've on many occasion said something a person found offensive even though there was no ill intent on my part. It has also had the effect of making me very literally minded, which as most of you know can be extremely harmful in a world where much information is conveyed as subtext. I think that was probably the main reason why I only realised what was going on at such a late stage in my life.


=== Slow release substance delivery device ===
I believe I have a device implanted in my thigh that is capable of periodically releasing substances into my blood stream. 

==== What for ====
I'm led to believe it releases steroids for the purposes of making me physically stronger and improving my appearance. I've had no indications that it is releasing anything else.

==== How do I know ====
I first had an indication when somebody indirectly implied that I had been given steroids. Looking back at my life I remembered numerous conversations where people would mention the word 'thyroid', which I now believe they were trying to hint at 'thigh roid'. 
I know roughly where the device could be located, half way up my left thigh. I've felt a very faint ache there for a number of years. From a young age I've always experienced pains in my left leg, probably being the reason for why I have an abnormal gait.

==== Negative effects ====
None that I am aware of.


=== Genetic modification ===
I've been led to believe that my genome has been edited using the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing CRISPR gene editing] technique. 

==== How do I know ====
I do not know when, and for what purpose. There are several [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing#Applications known uses]. I only believe this might be the case as I was once indirectly referred to as a 'mutant', implying that my genes had been modified. I have also had information concerning the CRISPR gene editing technique directed towards me, I assume for the purpose of making me aware of what had been done to me.

==== Negative effects ====
None that I am aware of.


== God is watching ==
I am led to believe that I am living under constant surveillance. I've been told that the test subjects of Project U lead a [[Wikipedia:The_Truman_Show|Truman Show]] like existence with all of their actions being broadcast to an 'audience' within the network. CCTV cameras, [[The_Network#Technological capabilities|hidden cameras in public spaces and throughout my home]] watch my movements at all times. You may think that the belief that my home is covered is hidden cameras demonstrates paranoid thought however I believe it because it has been proven to me. There are certain movements I have made going about my day to day business at home, things which nobody else could have seen, which are shown back to me when I view social media posts in the day or two after. Usually its a doctored picture/video of a celebrity copying that movement. Whether those video streams are being broadcast to an actual audience I do not know but they want me to know I am being watched. The reason for that is they believe that people will behave different if they think somebody is watching them in the same way a religious person may behave different if they think that God is always watching them. That is what they are trying to simulate, the idea that "God is always watching" and judging us.

They have applied this idea to my thoughts as well. By demonstrating that my thoughts are being read they perhaps believe that it will cause me to 'think' more morally. They have taken this a step further by actually 'punishing' me for bad thoughts. This is one one of the most evil aspects of the project. There are no circumstances in which it is ever OK to judge somebody based on what they are thinking. When I am successful in bringing this project into light, the act of 'thought policing' is something which I will campaign to be made illegal. Examples can be found on the [[Timeline#November_2020|timeline]].

== Inspiring self belief ==

This is a part of the project I like to call 'The Messiah Program'. Test subjects are told they are unique, that they have special purpose to fulfil. That God is with them and nothing can stop them. There is even talk of being the messiah, or chosen one. I can imagine how powerful this can be for some people if they believe it. There are examples from history of being holding such beliefs going on to achieve significant things. I avoided using the word great as some of those things achieved have been greats acts of evil, nevertheless they were able to become powerful leaders and and inspire many to join their cause whether for good or ill.

For many years this element of the program was never used on me. I've never been made to feel special and I've always thought of myself as ordinary with no aspirations to achieve greatness. That did change when I 'woke up' and began to understood what I was a part of. They did try to make me feel I could make a difference. There was a moment where they told me "only God can judge you" and in that moment I did almost believe it. At least I wanted to believe it. Unfortunately in the preceding months I had received so much abuse from the admins I could not believe it, my feelings for the project were extremely tainted with negative emotions. Perhaps that is another reason why the element of the network who represent the 'good' guys have chosen me to expose the project and stop it.


== Real world guidance ==

=== Audible feedback ===
I receive positive and negative audible feedback in order to guide me in difference areas of life. In matters of work I would hear positive sounds if I am on the right path, and negative sounds if I have made a mistake or made the wrong choice.

Examples of positive feedback sounds, include the sound of an engine revving, the sound of a double tap on a wooden surface, a bell sounding, people cheering in the distance.

The primary negative sound is the sound of an aircraft flying overhead, but the sound of police sirens are also common. Other negative feedback sounds include the sound of a baby crying, car/house alarms going off, noisy construction work.

Negative feedback example recorded on 26/01/2022: [https://www.projectu.link/sounds/negative_audible_feedback.mp3 Download Mp3]. The sound you hear at the beginning is me getting up from my chair to stand next to the window. You can hear the sound of an aircraft getting louder and then fading away. 

I also receive these sounds in response to thoughts which they deem to be good or bad. Positive thoughts like coming up with good ideas, or planning to do something which they deem beneficial will elicit a positive sound. Thoughts which they do not like can elicit the sound of a police siren. It makes me feel that my mind is being literally monitored by thought police. The stuff of dystopian nightmare for most, an unfortunate reality for myself and others.
