This is a timeline of some of the more memorable events that have occurred. It is by no means a complete list of everything I know or remember. I include it to give a rough picture of the overall order of events. 

==== 1986 - 1990 ====
I have a memory of an event from this time. I had been taken to a classroom full of children. I've always remembered it as a school trip even though I don't recognise any of the children I am with. We play for some time and towards the end I am taken to a room adjacent to the classroom where it is revealed that one of the mirrors was a one way mirror allowing those inside the room to observe what was happening in the classroom without being seen. 

==== 1988 - 1992 ====

I have memories from some point during this time which would suggest to me something had done to my brain. I would spend my break times in primary school, wandering the playing ground, with my mind racing with thoughts and ideas. I become socially withdrawn.

==== 2004 - 2008  ==== 

There was a period of time where I would experience almost uncontrollable rage in response to witnessing violence, usually in a movie or TV. I would recall barely being able to stay in my seat due to the intensity of the rage. It never led me to hurt anyone. I believe this was the result of some kind of brain conditioning. I had gotten into a fight at university just before this time, I suppose around 2003. I didn't do a very good job of defending myself so perhaps they decided to do something to help me overcome that problem. A bit of waste since I've never been in another fight since then. This lasted for a few years, either the conditioning wore off or they did something to undo it. I haven't experienced anything similar for a very long time i.e. rage in response to witnessing violence. 

==== December 2018 ====

I first began to suspect I was involved in something. People demonstrated indirectly that they knew details of my personal life which they should have had no way of knowing. I being noticing odd behaviours in people, on trains and other public places.

==== May 2019 ====

The moment I first realised my mind could be read occurred on a night during this month. I had a thought which elicited a [[Methods_Of_Help#Audible_feedback|positive response sound]], the sound of an engine revving. It prompted me to wonder if my mind could be read, so I thought the question. "Can you read my mind?" which again caused me to hear the sound of an engine revving. In the time since I've had countless confirmations. 
 
==== August 2019 ====

It was during this time that somebody gave me a copy of [[Wikipedia:The_Secret_(Byrne_book)|The Secret]]

==== October 2019 ====

It was during this time another book was left in my path. I can't remember the title of the book. It detailed a whole series of conspiracy theories and information about secretive groups. Two chapters stood out, one on the MKUltra project which I eventually come to learn was the basis of many of the technologies used on me. The second one concerned the [[Wikipedia:Stargate_Project|Stargate Project]].

==== November 2020 ==== 
This is an example of thought policing. There was a day where I became angry, over what I can't remember, but I used some foul language. Specifically the N-word several times. All in my head of course. I've never used that word directed at somebody out loud in my entire life. The next day whilst walking down Edgware road on my way to the supermarket a large black fellow was walking past me in the opposite direction. He was on the phone and just as I passed him he raised his voice and exclaimed loudly the word 'WHAT?', as if he didn't quite catch what the other person was saying and wanted them to repeat the word. 

==== December 2020 ==== 

I begin an [[How_I_Know_I_Have_A_Neural_Interface#Trying_to_isolate_and_record_transmissions_from_the_device|experiment]] to try and detect the wireless signals being emitted from the device. It takes me a couple of weeks. I then file a report at the nearest police station telling them what I suspect has been done to me. I give them the results of my experiment. They note down what I have to say but do not file an official report as they claim it would not get taken seriously and there is nothing they can do. I tell them if they were to help me find someone that could arrange a scan I could prove my story very quickly. They are unable to take such action, instead telling me I would be contacted by a community support team in the coming days. I recall missing a couple of phone calls which I never returned.

==== March 2021 ====

This event occurred whilst I was having dinner. I made some disparaging remarks against the Americans/CIA whilst watching a TV show and this happened the next day during the evening. I recall we were watching Sky News and the correspondent was interviewing an American live. I don't remember what they were talking about but I remember he uttered a phrase, something along the lines of 'my heart aches'.. Or 'my heart goes out' and at the same time he put his hand over his heart.  At that very moment I felt my own heart begin to hurt. Not strongly enough to cause alarm but enough to cause some discomfort. I suppose they wanted to send me a message, a reminder of the power they have over me and the state of virtual enslavement I am kept under.

==== April 2021 ====

There are two elements in the network administering the project. One represents God, the other represents Satan. I don't know if those elements are two people, or two groups of people. Regardless they play those two roles. There was a moment in the shower when I raged against the imaginary Satan in my mind, directly challenging him. I swore I would destroy him and in my mind I imagined holding him by the throat and forcing him to the ground. In the week that followed I suppose 'Satan' responded by causing me to have the most unsettling nightmares I've ever experienced:

* One where I was trapped in a tiny cage, not able to move. Like a battery caged chicken. I think this one was meant to show me that my mind has been imprisoned and that original thoughts and ideas were being farmed.
* One where I was wading through a room full of water. At some point I am sucked into a vortex and I experience my body disintegrating, as if I had been put through a blender. 
* One where I was speaking to an old childhood friend. He was concerned that I had been drinking too much and I was laughing off his concerns. I could see he had begun to cry and I put my arm around him to tell him not to worry. At the moment I felt myself being swallowed up by the ground and everything turning to flame. I heard a really deep and menacing growl, as if it had come from the depths of hell. The sound was of pure evil, like nothing I've ever heard before. Once I awoke and realised it was just a dream I shrugged it off but that moment where I was swallowed up into nothingness was one of the worst I'd ever experienced. 

==== 22nd May 2021 ==== 

Upon the night of the 22nd of May at around 11pm as I was going to sleep, I experienced sudden limb movements. These limb movements occurred in the moments just as I was about to fall asleep and the effect they had on me was to jolt me awake. This occurred at least 3 times. On the first two occasions I felt my arms move. On the third occasion I felt a leg move. All three times the movements occurred in the precise moment I was about to fall asleep resulting in me not being able to. Thankfully the interference did stop after about an hour and I did eventually manage to drift off. I did not experience any further sleep disturbing limb movements that night.

==== 22nd June 2021 ====

Upon the morning of this day, I experienced some angry thoughts. They were of the retaliatory kind, lashing out mentally against those who had enslaved my mind. Quite a reasonable feeling to have from time to time but they take a dim view of it regardless. They prefer silent obedience from their test subjects. 
Very shortly afterwards I heard a neighbours house alarm go off. Normally I wouldn't have thought anything of it but this had happened a few times in the preceding week. Usually following me doing something the controllers didn't like. Something as simple as reading an article can set these people off. Yesterday the alarm started blaring when I was reading an article on how Amazon was destroying millions of items every year instead of giving them to charity: [https://www.itv.com/news/2021-06-21/amazon-destroying-millions-of-items-of-unsold-stock-in-one-of-its-uk-warehouses-every-year-itv-news-investigation-finds link]. 

I put two and two together and figured they took a disliking to my angry thoughts. It only annoyed me a little at first and I was able to remain pretty calm whilst getting on with my work. I was actually quite impressed with my ability to remain so calm despite this impolite provocation.. But I made the mistake of daring them to carry on. 'Haha, I thought to myself, I could handle this all day, do your worst'. So of course, they obliged. Usually the alarm would stop after several minutes but this time the alarm kept repeating and turning itself back on after stopping, continuing for almost an hour. 

==== 7th July 2021 ==== 

I was watching the England v Denmark game with a friend in a bar in central London. My friend is a hacker so I thought he might be able to help me understand the device, perhaps decipher the wireless signals it was giving off. I had mentioned it to him in messages but hadn't mentioned anything about it to him when I met him initially. There was a moment during the game where he asked me about what was going on, so I began to explain some of my theories. At that moment one of the security guards standing near our table started to button up his jacket with a serious look on his face. I interpreted that to mean "button up" another way of saying keep quiet. Clearly this fellow had been tasked with keeping an eye on us, he was too far to listen to what we were saying in a noisy bar but close enough to send a clear visual signal.

==== 19th July 2021 ====

This night I experienced the sleep deprivation attack, experiencing sudden muscle movements in the precise moments I was about to fall asleep. This happened 4 times. I think the reason was because of a conversation I had with the barber earlier in the day. I told him about my theory that COVID denial and anti vaccine theories were being spread intentionally by actors within the finance industry to make the COVID pandemic worse so that it kills off more people. Specifically members of the older generation claiming a pension. When these people pass away the pension fund no longer has to pay out and they gain financially.

==== Q4 2021 ====

During the last few months of 2021, the more sinister side of Project U begins to become revealed to me. Up until that time, the external information input I had been getting was mostly positive, probably to prevent me becoming mentally unstable. During the entire year I demonstrated some measure of strength and resilience, working long hours for months at a time, transforming my physical fitness, staying clear from drugs and hardly drinking. Perhaps there were a few allies amongst the network that thought I might actually now be strong enough to put a stop to the project. I possess several traits which perhaps make me suitable for that task, understanding of current and future technologies, atheism and rational thinking. All test subjects are pushed towards belief in a higher power. But to truly believe in god is to live in a state of self-delusion. Sometimes that can help in life but to uncover this project would require someone like me, someone who interprets the world in strictly rational terms. 

There were several pieces of information I received which led me to believe a genocide or mass murder event could occur at some point in the near future. An unbelievable notion I agree, whilst there are cases of genocide around the world I had assumed the West had progressed passed just things. I suppose this could be a genocide of an entirely different kind, instantaneous, easy. No dragging people away to concentration camps. Just a button push and all that would be left would be to dispose of the bodies.

* I was directed to watch [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9686194/ War of the Worlds 2019] In that TV series it shows certain technologies which exists today which could be turned into weapons in the near future. It shows a robotic killing machine in the form of a dog, very similar to the dogs being developed by [[Wikipedia:Boston_Dynamics|Boston Dynamics]]. There is an event early on in the series where a large percentage of the population is killed off when a specific signal is transmitted across the world. This kind of mass murder event could easily be carried out in the real world if there comes a time when everyone has been implanted with  a neural interface. I believe these two things were inserted into the show to serve as a warning as to what can happen. There is a similar warning in the movie [[Wikipedia:V_for_Vendetta_(film)|V for Vendetta]] which speaks of a time called the Reclamation when all ethnic minorities are exterminated. 

* There were several times I noticed the word genocide being highlighted in something I was watching

* There was one mention of a weapon that could kill en masse whilst leaving all infrastructure intact

* It was hinted at that a certain part of the [[The_Network|network]] who hold fascist beliefs, plan to use the weapon to bring England back to a state where everyone is white. There could be similar plans across Europe or wherever they plan to deploy this technology. 

==== 22nd January 2022 ====

I send out a message to a large number of contacts on WhatsApp. The message contained a link to a 2 page PDF document giving a brief overview of what ProjectU is, some of the technologies involved, why I was concerned, and why everyone else should be concerned. The message and document served as a form of insurance to discourage attempts on my life over the following months. If I did happen to die then I would hope at the very least it would provide some credence to my story. With this insurance in place I would be able to take bolder steps into uncovering this scandal including writing a far more details a account and to start reaching out to those who could help me provide conclusive evidence.

==== 23rd January 2022 ====

I meet up with a good friend who I had not seen for a sometime. She was concerned about the message I had sent the day before. I tell her about my experiences and my fears for what the project means. About half way through I begin to experience a panic attack, I had difficulty breathing and struggled to speak. At the time I just attributed it to talking too much, and for too long about something stressful. In the days later I realised the panic attack could have been something remotely triggered in an attempt to get me to stop talking. In the movie [[Wikipedia:American_Ultra|American Ultra]], panic attacks are used as a way of controlling the character Mike, who is also an [[Wikipedia:Project_MKUltra|MK Ultra]] test subject.

Whilst walking around the park we passed a man twice. His facial expression was quite distinctive, it looked like he was making an effort to keep his mouth shut. I took that to mean he was sending me a message, trying to get me to keep my mouth shut. 

==== 24th January 2022 ====

I begin to create this Wiki.
