Project U is a complex science experiment with many aims and objectives. Project U is not its official name, just one I have chosen for the purposes of spreading awareness. The overall aim of the experiment  concerns finding ways to enhance human beings so they can perform beyond their natural capabilities. The project has existed in its current form for several decades, with test subjects being artificially enhanced with advanced technologies not known to the general public. I believe the original methods of enhancements involved psychological techniques and drug based treatments, however as technology developed, later test subjects such as myself began to also receive electronic implants such as the [[Methods_Of_Help#Neural_interface_device|neural interface]].

Test subjects are chosen at a young age, by what criteria I am not sure. I believe the reason for choosing young test subjects is that some of the technologies, such as the brain enhancing treatment, can only be used at an early stage of a persons life and they perhaps may not work once they have already matured into adults. This itself is controversial as a child is not able to provide informed consent. They are not even told they have been chosen to take part in this experiment. I myself only found out 3 years ago. I certainly would not have chosen this for myself given how I know how [[Methods_Of_Help|negatively]] it has effected my life. For every success story I'm sure there are countless more failures. Peoples whose lives have been ruined so that [[The_Network|others]] may profit. 

I am certain many aspects of this project are already illegal. We may implement further laws to explicitly prohibit some of the activities that have taken place in this project but that won't be enough. Protections must be put in place, tests be made available so that the public can check themselves to see if they have been implanted with any of the technologies involved. This is now something we will always need going forward. In the same way that laws alone are not enough to stop corporations polluting our environment, laws alone will not be enough to protect humanity. The danger comes not just from networks in the countries we live in, our international rivals are developing the same technologies. When going on holiday in the near future we may find ourselves coming back with more than just a tan. 

Some elements of the network have committed [[The_Network#Self_delusions|acts]] which have resulted in the deaths of many thousands of people. They would not hesitate to infest humanity with these technologies. They are waiting for two things. The first is for the costs of deploying and running the technology to come down sufficiently for the plan to become economically viable. The second is for the technology to become sufficiently so advanced that they could deploy it en masse without detection. Given the rate of scientific and technological progress it's not a matter of if this will happen, only a matter of when.


=== Aims of the project ===

==== Providing help to the individual ====

A core element of the project revolves around helping individuals reach and exceed their natural potential. From [[Methods_Of_Help#Inspiring_self_belief|inspiring self belief]] to more  direct [[Methods_Of_Help#Human_modifications|enhancements]] utilising advanced technologies, a variety of methods are used. 

Every test subject becomes an element within [[The_Network|The Network]] whether they eventually realise or not. With any success they achieve usually also benefiting the network. 

Any network which desires strength, understands that one of the activities it must undertake, is ensuring that each member of the network is as strong as possible. The network have turned that undertaking into a science, exploring all possible avenues by which this can be done. As science progresses, new technologies become available which they are readily willing to use.

==== Enhancing and improving behavioural control techniques ====

It is now common knowledge that data gathered from individuals, primarily harvested from their internet use is being amalgamated in centralised databases for the purposes of behavioural control and manipulation. The [[Methods_Of_Help#Neural interface device|neural interface]] which allows the gathering of an individuals thoughts is the end game of that journey. With the device in place, you are able to build up a complete picture of who a person is, what they like, dislike, fear, almost knowing them better than they know themselves. By understanding what a person fears, you could for instance, tailor a political campaign to exploit those fears. Something which was used to great effect by the [[Wikipedia:Vote_Leave|Vote Leave]] campaigning organisation during the [[Wikipedia:2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum|2016 Brexit Referendum]].  

Manipulation of populations by those in charge is nothing new, the game changer is this device which allows an unprecedented level of insight into a person, allowing for the creation of extremely well crafted and individualised nudges which are more difficult to detect and resist. The device also allows sending signals into a person neural system, providing additional vectors for manipulation such as altering somebody's mood and altering the content of a persons dreams. In more sinister cases the device is capable of triggering pain in areas which would make the subject fear for their life. It is capable of triggering panic attacks to deter a test subject from taking certain actions, a technique dramatized in the film [[Wikipedia:American_Ultra|American Ultra]], and something I have personally [[Timeline#23rd_January_2022|experienced]].

==== Test bed for technologies ====

The project provides a test bed for the long term use of technologies in a live environment. Whilst initial development and testing was no doubt done in laboratory conditions, long term testing of effects can only take place in the real world over long time periods. I have been referred to as a canary in a coal mine, a guinea pig, suggesting I was one of the first to receive some of these technologies and put them through long term, real world testing. 

==== Data harvesting ====

As well as providing the data required for behavioural manipulation, the data gathered by neural interfaces can mined for other purposes. The main one being the harvesting of ideas and intellectual property. On several occasions I've seen products and services spring up based on ideas that I've thought about, which I've never written down or discussed with anyone. 

The most interesting example of this occurred whilst I was working for a company providing digital entertainment services. The company sold movies, music, and books. Users could buy media, and that media would be available on their account for them to consume at any later date. The problem I saw was that there were already a number of companies all providing a similar service. I did not like the idea of spending money on a movie, essentially buying the rights to digitally own it, but then that movie being tied to one account from a single provider. Your collection would potentially be spread over a number of accounts, which felt untidy as a collector. The idea I imagined was when purchasing a digital product, a record of that purchase would be stored in a centralised database run by an independent entity. That centralised database would record all of your digital purchases from any provider so that all your rights to own digital products are recorded in one place. Any service providing digital products would then be able to reference this database to see if you had the rights to play a particular movie/song/book and make it available to you. It solved the problem of a provider going out of business and a person losing access to the products they had purchased with that company. This was an idea that I had never discussed with anyone, nor written down, or researched. It existed purely in my mind. About halfway through my time with that company I learned that they were considering partnering with a service called UltraViolet which provided the exact same service I had imagined: [https://www.uphe.com/faq/digital-hd-with-ultraviolet-faqs https://www.uphe.com/faq/digital-hd-with-ultraviolet-faqs]. At the time when I checked the UltraViolet website, it appeared to be hastily cobbled together.

I didn't think much of it at the time. This was long before I had any idea that my thoughts were being read. Looking back it was the most obvious example of an idea being taken from my mind, the very name of the service 'Ultra'Violet leaves me in no doubt. Many of the technologies which are used to 'enhance' us, come from project [[Wikipedia:Project_MKUltra|MK Ultra]].

During the last [[Timeline#Q4_2021|couple of months of 2021]], it was made apparent to me in one sense what I actually was to some of them. They referred to me as a farm animal. A thing that was being milked for resources. There were multiple references to my 'eggs' being stolen or eaten. Eggs I suppose being ideas for new businesses. One of the nightmares that they induced [[Timeline#April_2021|whilst I was sleeping]] was one of me being stuck in a tiny cage, which I recognised as being similar to the ones used for battery farming chickens. I think this abuse was actually an attempt to get me to react, and act against the project. They had been teaching me to stand up for myself. If they wanted me to stay calm and compliant they could have easily not given me these messages and dreams, but they knew what would happen if they pushed me in this way.

==== Increasing belief in God ====

Many of the technologies the network possess can be used to give test subjects 'supernatural' experiences. Things which appear to be magic. One of the effects this would have is to increase belief in the supernatural, and so perhaps increase belief in God. The network profess belief in God, and a higher power. In the west religious belief has been in serious decline. I believe they are trying to find a way to turn that tide. Perhaps when their systems of monitoring have become sophisticated enough and the [[The_Network#Technological_capabilities|artificial intelligence]] which is running the show becomes powerful enough, they will roll this out to far more people, allowing them to experience supernatural events which might increase their belief in God. 

I believe they want to simulate the [[Wikipedia:Second_Coming|Second Coming]] of Jesus. All of the test subjects are pushed towards a belief that they are the chosen one. That they could be a messianic figure. I suppose the administrators are waiting to see if any of the subjects end up living a life that would fit the bill. Someone worthy of playing the part. I became an atheist in my teens and since then have disqualified myself many times over, not that it is something that I would ever want. If they ever found such a person they would use their advanced technologies to make them appear like they have supernatural abilities and that they could perform miracles, so the world wide religious community would believe that the prophecy had been fulfilled, thus dramatically increasing their level of faith in God. Perhaps pushing believers towards the Abrahamic faiths as the primary bulk of the network are followers of those religions.

=== The Secret ===

This section concerns one of the ways the project justifies the need to be able to read a subjects mind. There is a book called [[Wikipedia:The_Secret_(Byrne_book)|The Secret]] which I was [[Timeline#August_2019|directed]] to read. Presumably other test subjects are also directed to read this book. The synopsis:

<blockquote>Byrne re-introduces a notion originally popularized by persons such as Madame Blavatsky and Norman Vincent Peale that '''thinking about certain things will make them appear in one's life'''. Byrne provides examples of historical persons who have allegedly achieved this. Byrne cites a three-step process: '''ask, believe, and receive'''. This is based on a quotation from the Bible's Matthew 21:22: "And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive..
</blockquote>

Those who think rationally would of course think this to be impossible. You cannot manifest things in the real world with your mind. You could however make somebody believe they were manifesting things with their mind if you could read it and ensure that they received the things they asked for. That is what I suppose is the innocent 'cover' for the project and the administrators justification for invading somebody's mind. 

I can't really say this one worked for me. I became an atheist in my teens so haven't prayed for a very long time and had never asked for anything in prayer. A shame I suppose since without that I am just left with the downsides of having a neural interface. My atheism now is so well developed, I couldn't fake belief in god no matter how hard I tried.


=== Automation ===

I have been led to believe that much of the project is now orchestrated automatically by an [[The_Network#Technological capabilities|artificial intelligence]]. My thoughts & actions are constantly monitored. All of that data is fed into an AI which analyses it and responds in a variety of ways, most commonly by triggering [[Methods_Of_Help#audible_feedback|audible feedback]] when I am on the right or wrong path. 

Automation is essential if the project is to be rolled out to the wider population in an economically viable way. The number of people you could monitor and control is limited by the computational power of the machines running the AI.


=== Positive aspects of Project U ===

* Some test subjects do achieve great success in life.

* The blood transfusions given to test subjects give them something anyone would value: Prolonged youth.


=== What's wrong with Project U ===

* Test subjects are chosen when they are children before they are able to provide informed consent to the life changing technologies used on them.

* Test subjects are not told they are a part of the project. Many of the things a test subject experiences as part of the process can be confusing & scary. If a person does not have a scientific/technical background they can easily be broken by the experience as has happened to some. The administrators do not abort the project for that test subject, they do not come to their rescue and explain what they have done. Instead they leave test subjects to rot in institutions for years. Preferring to stay hidden rather than take responsibility for their crimes. 

* Test subjects can be subjected to abuses. As my opposition to the project and the network running it grew, so too did the abuses I suffered. I've been frequently indirectly referred to as a dog in social media, and in person. Sometimes when I have certain thoughts which if implemented would harm the network, such as nationalisation of certain industries, I am subjected to the sounds of dogs barking. I suppose that is something that abusers do, dehumanise their victim to make it easier to treat them like an animal. I have received more death threats than I can count, all delivered in strange and creative ways. I have been threatened with heart attacks, strokes, cancer, being shot in a drive by, being burned alive on a pile of wood, being drowned, being burned alive in a car accident, being stabbed on the street, being framed for a crime I did not commit. 

* The [[Methods_Of_Help#Brain_altering_treatment|brain altering treatment]] is severely detrimental to a person quality of life. Whilst it may increase intelligence, a person becomes impaired in other ways developing symptoms similar to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome Asperger Syndrome].

* The [[Methods_Of_Help#Neural interface device|neural interface]] is the most disturbing piece of technology used in the project. It takes away one of the things most precious to a person, a thing which most take for granted, the privacy of ones mind. A place that is supposed to be a sanctuary one can escape to in the darkest of times, instead, defiled and violated. The neural interface grants the controller the ability to move a test subject around like a marionette, to cause pain, to steal a persons intellectual property, to alter mood, cause panic attacks, even the ability to murder by remote control. If this technology is rolled out to the wider population, we would in effect become enslaved to the network. In a worse case scenario the network could use the technology to commit genocide, wiping out entire ethnic groups. All technologies which can be weaponised and use to commit mass murder are controlled with the strictest of regulations. This one should be no different.
