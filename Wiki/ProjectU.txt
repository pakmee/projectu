=== Aims of the project ===

Whilst the project could be most simply described as a charitable endeavour aimed at providing individuals help, it is in reality rather complex with a multitude of elements. The project provides value for [[TheNetwork|administrators of the project]] in several ways. 

==== Providing help to the individual ====

The main element is of course helping individuals achieve success in life using a [[Methods_Of_Help|variety of methods]]. If a network of people desire to be strong, then it's individual components must be strong. The project takes the science of strengthening individuals to its extreme limit. 

==== Enhancing and improving behavioural control techniques ====

It is now common knowledge that data gathered from individuals, primarily harvested from their internet use is being amalgamated in centralised databases for the purposes of behavioural control and manipulation. The [[Methods_Of_Help#Neural interface device|neural interface]] which allows the gathering of an individuals thoughts is the end game of that journey. With the device in place, you are able to build up a complete picture of who a person is, what they like, dislike, fear, almost knowing them better than they know themselves. Whilst we may forget things as time progresses, this data never need be deleted. 
On an individual level, this allows the network to manipulate an individual towards taking certain actions that might help and benefit them and so help the network. It could also be used in an opposing manner to manipulate someone into actions which are harmful. I've experienced both negative and positive forms. 
Manipulation of populations is nothing new, the game changer is this device which allows an unprecedented level of insight into a person, allowing for the creating of extremely well crafted and individualised nudges which are more difficult to detect and resist. The device also allows sending signals into a person neural system, providing additional vectors for manipulation such as altering somebody's mood and altering the content of a persons dreams. In more sinister cases the device is capable of triggering pain in areas which would make the subject fear for their life.

==== Test bed for technologies ====

The project provides a test bed for the long term use of technologies in a live environment. Whilst initial development and testing was no doubt done in laboratory conditions, long term testing of effects can only take place in the real world over long time periods. I have been referred to as a canary in a coal mine, a guinea pig, suggesting I was one of the first to receive some of these technologies and put them through long term, real world testing. 

==== Data harvesting ====

As well as providing the data required for behavioural manipulation, the data can mined for other purposes. The main one being the harvesting of ideas and intellectual property. On several occasions I've seen products and services spring up based on ideas that I've thought about, which I've never written down or discussed with anyone. 

The most interesting example of this occurred whilst I was working for a company providing digital entertainment services. The company sold movies, music, and books. Users could buy media, and that media would be available on their account for them to consume at any later date. The problem I saw was that there were already a number of companies all providing a similar service. I did not like the idea of spending money on a movie, essentially buying the rights to digitally own it, but then that movie being tied to one account from a single provider. Your collection would potentially be spread over a number of accounts, which felt untidy as a collector. The idea I imagined was when purchasing a digital product, a record of that purchase would be stored in a centralised database run by an independent entity. That centralised database would record all of your digital purchases from any provider so that all your rights to own digital products are recorded in one place. Any service providing digital products would then be able to reference this database to see if you had the rights to play a particular movie/song/book and make it available to you. It also solved the problem of a provider going out of business and a person losing the products they had purchased with that company. This was an idea that I had never discussed with anyone, nor written down, or researched. It existed purely in my mind. About halfway through my time with that company I learned that they were considering partnering with a service called UltraViolet which provided the exact same thing I had imagined: [https://www.uphe.com/faq/digital-hd-with-ultraviolet-faqs https://www.uphe.com/faq/digital-hd-with-ultraviolet-faqs]

I didn't think much of it at the time. This was long before I had any idea that my thoughts were being read. Looking back it was the most obvious example of an idea being taken from my mind, the very name of the service 'Ultra'Violet leaves me in no doubt. Many of the technologies which are used to 'enhance' us, come from project [[Wikipedia:Project_MKUltra|MKUltra]].

During the last couple of months of 2021, it was made apparent to me in one sense what I actually was to some of them. They referred to me as a farm animal. A thing that was being milked for resources. That my 'eggs' were being stolen. Eggs I suppose being ideas for new businesses. One of the nightmares that they induced [[Timeline|whilst I was sleeping]] was one of me being stuck in a tiny cage, which I recognised as being similar to the ones used for battery farming chickens. 


=== The Secret ===

This section concerns one of the ways the project justifies the need to be able to read a subjects mind. There is a book called [[Wikipedia:The_Secret_(Byrne_book)|The Secret]] which I was directed to read. Presumably other test subjects are also directed to read this book. The synopsis:

<blockquote>Byrne re-introduces a notion originally popularized by persons such as Madame Blavatsky and Norman Vincent Peale that thinking about certain things will make them appear in one's life. Byrne provides examples of historical persons who have allegedly achieved this. Byrne cites a three-step process: ask, believe, and receive.[9] This is based on a quotation from the Bible's Matthew 21:22: "And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive..
</blockquote>

Those who think rationally would of course think this to be impossible. You cannot manifest things in the real world with your mind. You could however make somebody believe they were manifesting things with their mind if you could read it and ensure that they received the things they asked for. That is what I suppose is the innocent 'cover' for the project and the administrators justification for invading somebody's mind. To be able to give them a 'beautiful' ability.

I can't really say this one worked for me. I became an atheist in my teens so haven't prayed for a very long time and had never asked for anything in prayer. A shame I suppose since without that I am just left with the downsides of having a neural interface. My atheism now is so well developed, I couldn't fake belief in god no matter how hard I tried.
