=== Project U ===
The purpose of this site is to collate information related to my involvement in what I am calling 'Project U'. Viewed from a certain perspective, Project U is a charitable endeavour operated primarily by entities in the private sector. Individuals are selected at a young age, and are subsequently helped throughout their life in a [[Methods_Of_Help|variety of ways]] to help them become successful with the hope that they will go on to achieve great things. Whilst some of the methods used to help are uncontroversial there are others which would certainly be considered illegal and dangerous.  It is of upmost importance that the details of this secretive project become public knowledge as the technologies involved have an extreme potential for misuse. It is no understatement that they pose a grave threat to humanity with the potential to allow a minority to exert an extreme level of behavioural control over the rest of the population in the best case, and in the worst case the technology can be weaponised and used as a tool to commit mass murder & genocide. 

My knowledge of the project comes from having been selected as an individual to receive help. I had no idea of that fact up until around 3 years ago. Since then I have learned more and more about what the project is and what has been done to me. The last few months in particular have been illuminating in terms of not only understanding the negative implications of this project to me as an individual but how events will most likely unfold in the near future if the project is allowed to continue unopposed. Given what I now know I have no choice but to act. My aim is to build as detailed of an account as possible so people can understand the potential threat this project poses. I hope to spread this information as far as possible to raise awareness and to hopefully find individuals who can help me obtain the definitive proof needed to take this story to national media outlets. If what I believe is true, that proof can quickly and easily be obtained.
