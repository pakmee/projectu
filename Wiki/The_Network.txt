=== Methodology required to understand The Network ===

When talking about the project administrators it would be all too easy to delve into the world of conspiracy theory so I will try and build up a picture of them for you in a more rational way. 

The project administrators are primarily a network of wealthy and powerful individuals in the private sector. They collaborate and coordinate their activities in ways which are completely hidden from the general public. A simple example of collaboration is price fixing i.e. companies which are competitors to the general public but coordinate in secret to fix prices and agree not to undercut each other. 

The key thing to take away from that example is that private sector entities '''collaborate''', and they do so with as much '''secrecy''' as possible, going to great lengths to hide their activities. 

Now because they act in secret and go to great lengths to hide their activities, you will not often find direct evidence for who they are or what they do. Instead you must be able to infer what is highly probably based on known facts. Those trained in the scientific method like myself usually look for conclusive evidence before accepting a piece of information and allowing it to form part of our view of the world. It is probably for that reason I was blind to them for so long. If you hope to stand a chance of understanding this network you must be able to work out what is going on by thinking strategically and working out what is most likely, instead of looking for direct evidence. It is understandable that the activities of this group, go on unnoticed by most of the general public. The process of understanding them, can be time consuming and without the motivation for doing so, most people would not bother. My motivation was trying to understand who had implanted the neural chip inside me, who was reading my thoughts and causing me to have the experiences I was having. It was something which mattered to me a great deal so I expended much time and effort in pursuit of that understanding. 

Inferring information requires starting points. Basic facts that you know to be true. The more facts you have the better the picture you are able to form. Based upon those known facts you can infer other facts which have an extremely high probability of being true. These facts may not be things you are able to find direct evidence for but you can hold a high degree of certainty that they are true. Based upon those, further highly probably inferences can be made. It is something all people/networks/armies must do when faced with rivals/enemies who go to great lengths to keep their activities hidden. If you are not willing to do that, if you only accept things which you have direct evidence for, then you stand no hope of understanding them. You must be able to think strategically, be able to form a picture from limited information.


=== Primary inferences ===

I will now share with you some important inferences I made. These form my foundational knowledge, the facts which can be built upon to create further understanding. Some of these I have only come to know because of my experience being a test subject of Project U:

* '''They are extremely wealthy''' - This one should not be that hard to accept. They possess a great deal of wealth. I know that because the administration of Project U can only be done at great cost. In recent times when talking about dealing with the challenges of climate change you may have heard the phrase that "whilst national governments can invest billions, the private sector can unleash trillions". I first heard that phrase last year but before then I 'guessed' that this group must have collective wealth measuring in that region.  

* '''They possess advanced technologies''' - This fact I understand because of the nature of the technologies used in me. The neural interface I possess is far in advance of what is known to be at the [https://neuralink.com/ cutting edge] so I presume that they hold a technological advantage in many other areas as well. Some of those technologies I have witnessed [[The_Network#Technological_capabilities|first hand]], I have hypothesised the likely existence of others. 

* '''They behave strategically''' -  This fact is extremely important. I inferred it over a long period by observing their interactions with me and understanding their other activities. It became obvious they were behaving in an extremely strategic manner, with almost military discipline. They are well versed in the [[Wikipedia:The_Art_of_War|Art of War]]. I highlight this important fact because you can infer a great deal of information just by understanding a network is behaving strategically. It makes them predictable. There are certain things a strategic entity will do, moves that they will always make because that is the ''best'' move to make. This is especially useful when it comes to inferring capabilities of the network. If the network has vast amounts of wealth, how would they likely use that wealth? What technologies would they most likely develop that would give them a strategic advantage?

* '''Right wing/Neoliberal''' - They generally hold right wing views. They could be described as [[Wikipedia:Neoliberalism|neoliberal]]. Neoliberalism can be most simply described as a religion invented for the purpose of justifying greed. The religion tells you greed is a good thing, and it becomes something you believe without question. Many of the networks activities, in accumulating a vastly disproportionate amount of wealth to themselves could be described by many outside observers as greedy. This outlook has another effect which is beneficial to the network as it tends to create societies with larger wealth gaps between rich and poor. They would say that is a good thing because it motivates people to work harder to escape poverty however it creates an underclass of desperate people more willing to bend their own morality for financial benefit. Desperate people very useful for my next point..

* '''They have many subordinates willing to do their bidding''' - The network possess a vast army of people willing to do their bidding. Wherever I have visited there always seems to be people waiting to give me a sign, a hand signal, to send me a message in passing conversation as they walk passed. There have been a few cases where I recognise the same face in entirely two distant locations but that is rare. It is not a case that I feel I am being followed, instead I walk into the network wherever I go, it is everywhere. Certainly in London, perhaps in other parts they are fewer in number. There are countless other activities that these subordinates would be engaged in, all serving the network.


=== Divisions ===

The Network does not speak with a single voice. It is made up of people and subgroups who hold different views. Some of those people have been helping me, some have been hindering me. Whilst I consider Project U fundamentally evil in nature, I would not consider the entire network to be made of up evil people. They network are so powerful and seemingly unbeatable that I'm sure many of their membership fall in line because it's the strategically sound thing to do. If you can't beat them, join them as they say. 

I don’t know all the different subdivisions of the network. I understand at a high level there are some who are good and serve God, represented by white. There are others who are evil and serve ‘Satan’, represented by black. I think the reason for this is that the network recognises for it to survive and succeed in a hostile world, sometimes requires deeds which most would consider evil, rendering you to need both types of people. An example of such an act would be the spreading of COVID denial and Anti-Vax theories in an effort to allow the virus to spread. That action would have the effect of killing off some of the older population who have retired, thus relieving some of financial the burden on the remaining working population. 

Different networks exist in different countries. While they cooperate at a high level, leading some to believe that they form a secretive world government, they do compete with each other. Networks in each country looks after their own interests utilising every [[Wikipedia:Game_theory|trick]] in the book to do so. 


=== Religious belief === 

It is important for everyone in the network to hold some form of religious belief. That is one of the rules for joining, you must believe in some kind of higher power. They tried to push me towards many, they didn't seem to care too much which one as long as I believed. Of course this was an impossible task for me as the reasons for my atheism are very well developed. I can't fake religious belief, I can't fake anything. In implanting me with a mind reading neural interface and exposing all my private thoughts, they had taken that right away from me. If I faked it they would know. I found this an extremely interesting conundrum. I wonder how many of them would be revealed as atheists if they too had mind reading neural interfaces. 


=== Self delusions === 

Some of their activities are good, some are evil. However as 'religious' folk, they must always appear to be doing good so they have developed an extremely effective method of self-delusion that covers up acts of evil with acts of help. In that way they are able to commit acts of evil whilst still 'believing' that they are doing some good.

This perfectly describes Project U, in that the administrators claim to be just 'helping' people when in reality it is a cover for many of the projects more [[ProjectU#Aims_of_the_project|sinister purposes]].

I take another example from a TV show I watched recently called [[Wikipedia:Dopesick_(miniseries)|Dope Sick]]. It tells the true story of how the actions of executives at Purdue Pharmaceuticals caused an [https://rightpathaddictioncenters.com/how-purdue-pharma-perpetrated-the-opioid-crisis/ opioid epidemic], resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans. Throughout the show the executives repeated to themselves a lie, a self-delusion, insisting that they simply wanted to "help heal the world of it's pain". I don't know if they actually used that phrase in reality but it typifies the kind of mentality, which creators of the show understood wanted to portray.

The network likes to be referred to as a 'higher power'. Their technologies do allow them to appear to have supernatural powers. As Arthur C. Clarke once said: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic". The wealth and power they have obtained lead them to believe they are better than everyone else, that they have the right to take decisions on humanity's behalf. They invade our privacy and continuously watch over us with intrusive surveillance technologies, believing they have the right to play the role of god. They take actions which can have far reaching consequences for the rest of the population with no democratic oversight. Project U is a perfect example of their arrogance. It is a reckless endeavour which could very easily have catastrophic consequences for the human race.


=== Technological capabilities === 

I will list some of the technological capabilities that they have:

* Surveillance technologies - They have hidden cameras and microphones which are impossible to detect which the naked eye. Some are hidden in walls, others are hidden in televisions, LED lights. They have access to most if not all public cameras, enabling them to gather a vast amount of intelligence. They have access to aerial surveillance drones which run silently and are not easily visible to the naked eye. 

* Neural interface - As well as deploying neural interfaces in human beings, I have reason to believe there are a wide range of animals which have been implanted with these devices. I have observed extremely odd behaviours in squirrels, domestic cats, swans which suggest to me that they are being controlled remotely. The technology was [[Wikipedia:Project_MKUltra|originally]] developed using animals so this shouldn’t be hard to believe, as incredible as it might initially sound. These animals were used to send [[Methods_Of_Help#Being_pointed_in_the_right_direction|signals to me]] but the fact that they all have neural interfaces mean that they can also function as surveillance devices allowing the operator to view and hear what the animal can. 

* Biological weapons - They have access to a wide array of biological offensive capabilities. They are able to inflict individuals with all manner of illnesses including Cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Multiple sclerosis. Those are just the ones which have been highlighted to me, no doubt there are countless others.

* Computational capabilities - They have many advanced computing capabilities. I'm led to believe they have an extremely advanced artificial intelligence, I don't know how advanced or what exactly they're using it for. They're probably looking to create an AI that is self aware, can learn and adapt to any task. It would be a tremendous strategic advantage to control an AI which is capable of developing and researching new technologies on its own. An AI could possibly used to predict the future, likely outcomes of different actions. In terms of ProjectU, I've been led to believe that many aspects of the project are run automatically by an AI. Many of the systems that help me and provide guidance are not driven manually. This is essential if the technology is to be scaled up to the rest of the population. I'm ''guessing'' that they have a fully working quantum computer given the state of what the current publicly known cutting edge is and that The Network are at least a decade ahead of that. Many forms of encryption that we currently use would be useless against a quantum computer.

* Behavioural nudging capabilities - Much has been made of the way our data is being amalgamated and used to manipulate our behaviours. They of course have developed this capability much further than people know. It ensures that they can manipulate populations into continuing to vote for political parties who are friendly to the network. Those parties which seek to remove regulations and oversight so that the network is more easily able to siphon away public money. There are many other reasons for which you might wish to manipulate the behaviours of individuals. You may wish to promote climate science denial to ensure fossil fuel companies are able to operate freely for as long as possible. COVID denial and anti vax theories are promoted as a way of encouraging the virus to spread so that vulnerable older people are killed off for the benefit of companies in the financial sector.

* Cyberwarfare capabilities - They possess a powerful capability to compromise virtually any electronic device. They usually have back door access into internet service providers in the countries where they operate which makes it easy for them to be able to hack and gain control over devices connected to the internet such as mobile phones and personal computers. All of my devices have been compromised, meaning that anything that I do on those devices is visible to them. Any work or intellectual property I create can be stolen with ease. They can also modify the contents of what I am browsing online, creating fake news stories that only I can see, or other misinformation designed to lead me astray. I'm led to believe that most electronic devices that I've purchased online contain compromised electronics. Power strips, projectors, televisions, monitors, microwaves, fridges, washing machines, head phones etc. These devices can contain wireless devices enabling the relay of the wireless transmissions from my neural interface. I've heard tell of instances where a household appliance was made to malfunction and start a fire.

* Deep faking - The have the capability to produce [[Wikipedia:Deepfake|deepfakes]] which are indistinguishable from the real thing. That allows them to fake phone conversations or video conference participants. It allows them to modify the content of media consumed through streaming services, live as they happen. I've witnessed the content of something I've been streaming being obviously manipulated in response to something that I had just been thinking.

* Weather control technologies - They have the capability to alter the weather in a localised area. They can make it rain, which is one of the ways they give negative feedback. Most likely achieved using [[Wikipedia:Cloud_seeding|Cloud Seeding]]. They can also cause the sun to appear to shine slightly more brightly over a particular spot, to deliver positive feedback. Possibly achieved using a satellite to reflect and magnify the rays of the sun over a particular location. I've also experienced a moment where they made it snow, just after an event where I imagine they would want to give me really negative feedback. I was in an area surrounded by tall buildings at the time so this could easily have been achieved with a snow machine in that particular case.

* Advanced robotics - I have been led to believe they posses advanced robotics capable of performing surgeries on human beings. Such machines are now quite common but theirs would be far more advanced, perhaps being capable of performing a surgery with no human input. This could be one of them methods they used to implant the device into me although I have had information to suggest that was the case. It certainly would be one way of being able to deploy these technologies at scale.
