This page details the things I have experienced that convince me I have a neural interface. I'm a [[Wikipedia:Humanism|Humanist]], understanding the world in a rational way is an important part of my life. This page details the things I've experienced that leave me no choice but to conclude logically that my mind is being read. If you're looking for evidence I provide some details into the experiments I've done. They are not conclusive. My plan to obtain definitive proof will come later, after I've completed writing my full account. 

=== Plausibility ===

Whilst my claim is difficult to believe, I first wish to demonstrate that it is plausible. That it is not something that only exists as science fiction and that the technology is feasible and the evidence for it already exists. 

I would first draw your attention to this article about the project [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra MKUltra]. The opening section ends with this sentence "In December 2018, declassified documents revealed that the CIA made six dogs run, turn, and stop via remote control and brain implants as part of MKUltra." There are two articles referenced [https://nypost.com/2018/12/11/cia-once-secretly-implanted-mind-control-devices-in-dogs-brains/ nypost.com] and [https://www.newsweek.com/cia-mkultra-documents-files-remote-control-dogs-1250519 newsweek.com].
These experiments were done in the 60's. I'm sure you would agree that technology has progressed much since then. It provides evidence at the very least of devices capable of transmitting signals into a brain remotely via wireless signals. I am not claiming that the CIA did this to me, only that they perhaps were the first to experiment with those technologies.

I would next draw your attention to a company called [https://neuralink.com/ Neuralink]. They have demonstrated the use of a neural interface device in a monkey, allowing it to play a video game with its mind. Of course the device in my brain is far in advance of what they have demonstrated but we must work under the assumption that the organisation who run this experiment possess technology which is at least 10 years in advance of what the general public know to be possible.

=== Why am I convinced ===

The fact that my mind can be read has been demonstrated to me on countless occasions in several ways. 

==== Audible feedback in response to thoughts ====

One of the most frequent is positive and negative audio feedback I receive in response to various kinds of thoughts, detailed [[Methods_Of_Help#Audible_feedback|here]]. This has happened thousands of times.

==== Seeing online content which highly relate to recent thoughts ====

Another common way is for me to see a social media post whose contents highly relate to a recent thought I've had. I'll give an example from this morning (27/01/2022). To give context I'm half way through writing the contents of this Wiki. One of the things I was thinking about that night was how to explain my theory of how these devices are surgically implanted into my head. I imagine the surgeries occur whilst I am sleeping, perhaps in hotel rooms. I imagined a hidden square section of the wall behind the bed coming away to reveal surgical instruments which could be operated remotely, perhaps even autonomously. Far fetched perhaps, not so if you remember that they possess technology [[The_Network|far in advanced]] of what we know is possible. Regardless, when I started browsing social media this morning the first post I saw on Reddit was this [https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/sdgmh8/patio_with_hidden_table_and_benches/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 one]. It shows something hidden being deployed from a flat surface in the same way I had imagined less than an hour earlier. This has happened 100's of times. Usually in one of the first posts I am browsing through, not always the first.

==== Strangers saying something which sound like a response to a thought  ====

This occurs with much less frequency than the previous two as it can only happen when I'm in public around other people. Sometimes as I'm walking past a person I will catch a sentence or two from their conversation, and the sentence they speak almost forms a response to a thought I've had in the last few seconds. Now I realise for that to happen, my thought must be read remotely, a response formed and then sent to the person I'm just about to walk past so they can say that out loud, all in a matter of a few seconds. It does sound improbable but I've experienced it frequently enough that I don't think it could happen just by chance. A rather grim example is one where I was walking through Epping Forest and was thinking about how [[The_Network|the network]] might choose to kill me in a horrible way. I remember seeing an article about North Korea and how sometimes prisoners were eaten alive by dogs and had that thought in my mind, we were walking passed a couple at that moment and the lady said "Oh, not that one". The sentence was said slightly louder than the rest of the conversation, highlighting it to me. This has happened dozens of times.

==== Hearing the device itself  ====

This has happened rarely, there were 3 occasions where I believe I could hear the device itself. I'm not sure what was happening to it but I could hear a distinct electronic high pitched sound in my head, the sound would change frequency halfway, almost as if the device retuning itself. After a few seconds the sound would stop. The sensation was not painful, but did cause some alarm as it almost seemed the device was malfunctioning, given how rarely it happens, it can't be part of the devices normal function.

==== Involuntary limb movements  ====

I've experienced involuntary limb movements on several occasions suggesting that there is a device and it is capable of transmitting into my nervous system. There have been a couple of nights where I believe the administrators were trying to subject me to [[Timeline#22nd_May_2021|sleep deprivation]]. In the moments just as I would be falling asleep I would feel my legs move quite suddenly, jolting me into a state of alertness and preventing me from going to sleep. This would continue for about an hour. This possibly may not have been done with malicious intent, perhaps it was their way of showing me how this technology could be misused in order that I actually fight back. It has not happened that often.
There have been a few occasions where I would be watching something on television and I would feel my hand or leg move towards the screen, every time because they wanted to highlight something I had just seen.

==== Feeling my heart rate change  ====

There was one occasion where I felt my heart rate instantly go up for a few seconds before reverting to its normal pace in a way which felt completely unnatural and artificial. I was being visited by a couple from the US. I had not seen them for sometime. It was as one of them approached me that my heart rate jumped. I think that was meant to serve as a warning as to what could happen if I went to the US, I could be taken out with an induced heart attack. Around that time there was a possibility I could go there for work. Again this was an event that demonstrated remote control of bodily function, only possible with a neural interface.


=== Evidence so far ===

I have tried a couple of things on my own to try and find proof for the existence of this device. 

==== Metal detector ====

I purchased a metal detector from [https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07NTZTMBG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1 Amazon] to see if that would pick up any of the implants. When pointing the device at my chest and head, it did give off a reading to suggest there was something there. Later research suggested that metals in the blood can also cause positive readings, however I conducted that research by posting on online forums and I can't be sure that those responding were fake accounts just trying to lead me off the trail. I believe this is probably the easiest method of detecting the presence of the device, if conducted by a professional with a higher quality metal detector.

==== Trying to isolate and record transmissions from the device ====

I theorised that if the device is continuously transmitting my thoughts, it should be possible to detect those transmissions. I purchased a device called a [https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/ HackRF One]. It is a Software Defined Radio peripheral capable of transmission or reception of radio signals from 1 MHz to 6 GHz. If the device is using conventional WIFI or cellular towers for communication then the transmission would fall within that frequency range. I also constructed a [[Wikipedia:Faraday_cage|Faraday Cage]] which is an enclosure designed to block electromagnetic fields. My rudimentary cage is a box, wrapped in 60 layers of metal catering foil. I theorised if I could create a space which was free from radio signals, if I placed myself in the space, any signals I detect must be coming from me. 

I conducted several experiments, trying to narrow down frequency ranges at which the signals were strongest. I was able to detect significant activity in a frequency range between 2400 MHz and 2510 MHz. The original recordings were placed on a drive whose data became corrupted, however I created a report which I [[Timeline#December_2020|submitted to the police]]. The scan of that document can be downloaded here: [https://www.projectu.link/signalanalysis/page1.png page 1] [https://www.projectu.link/signalanalysis/page2.png page 2] [https://www.projectu.link/signalanalysis/page3.png page 3] [https://www.projectu.link/signalanalysis/page4.png page 4]
 
The Faraday cage itself was of imperfect construction. Some interference could be detected so an improved experiment would use a professionally constructed shielded space.

=== Obtaining conclusive evidence ===

Obtaining conclusive evidence should be very straightforward with the right equipment. I presume an X-Ray would be enough to show the device. The difficulty comes in that the [[The_Network|project administrators]] would not want me to reveal the nature of the project given the lengths to which they have kept this secret. They possess tremendous wealth and power, demonstrating the capability to produce deep fake images and video with ease. One would presume that they would have covered all their bases in terms of common places one would go that could possibly reveal the nature of the implants. I'm certain any device which I might encounter in a medical setting would be compromised and produce doctored images, hiding anything suspicious. My hope then would be to find a facility which has a scanning device which could not be compromised, without digital components which could easily be hacked. 

I am also hopeful because there are clearly people amongst the administrators who have been helping me. So much information has been shared, especially concerning the potentially negative implications this project could have, that I can only presume they need me to succeed.
